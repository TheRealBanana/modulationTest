# modulationTest

Just messing around, trying to get some simple Amplitude Modulation to work.
I really hate this code because of the hard-coded values. I just don't have a firm enough grasp on the math to create more elegant code at the moment.

Next up, after I get a good grasp of AM, I will work on FM.
